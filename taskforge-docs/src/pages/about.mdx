# About TaskForge

TaskForge was created for teams who prefer terminals, Git, and automation over
spreadsheets and sticky notes. Our mission is to make project management tools
that feel as natural as your command line.

:::info
TaskForge is built by a fully remote team spread across multiple timezones.
We design everything asynchronously by default, so our tooling reflects that.
