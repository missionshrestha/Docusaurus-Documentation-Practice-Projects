Today we're excited to ship **TaskForge v1.0.0-beta**—our first public beta release.

This release focuses on solidifying the core experience: projects, tasks, CLI, and API.

## Highlights

- 🧰 New `taskforge init` flow with clearer prompts
- ✅ Improved task listing and filtering in the CLI
- 🔐 API authentication and rate limiting now enabled by default
- ⚙️ Structured `taskforge.config.json` with environments support

## Breaking changes

:::warning
This beta includes a breaking change to the way `projectId` is handled in
`taskforge.config.json`. If you previously edited `projectId` by hand, please read the
[Config File](/docs/reference/config-file) docs carefully before upgrading.
:::

- Projects created with older previews may need to be reinitialized.
- The CLI now refuses to run if `projectId` is missing or mismatched.

## API updates

- All endpoints are now served from `https://api.taskforge.dev/v1`.
- Rate limits are enforced at `100 requests/minute` per API key.
- Error responses include consistent `error` and `message` fields.

See the [API Overview](/docs/reference/api-overview) for details and `curl` examples.

## CLI updates

- `taskforge task add` now accepts `--assignee` and `--due` flags.
- `taskforge task list` adds a `--status` filter.
- `taskforge --config` lets you point to a specific config file.

Check out the [CLI Usage](/docs/guides/cli-usage) guide to see all available commands.

## What's next

Over the coming weeks we'll be focusing on:

- Smoother onboarding for new teams
- Deeper integrations with CI providers
- More examples and templates in the docs
