Happy New Year—and welcome to **TaskForge** 🎉

TaskForge is a project management platform designed specifically for developers
and technical teams. Instead of forcing you into a UI-only workflow, TaskForge
meets you where you already work:

- A clean, minimal web dashboard
- A powerful CLI for automation
- A simple, well-documented REST API

With TaskForge you can:

- Spin up new projects in seconds
- Manage tasks from your terminal or CI
- Keep your team aligned without leaving your dev tools

If you're curious to try it out, start with the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart)
and create your first project today.
