TaskForge organizes work into **projects**. A project typically represents a product,
team, or client. In this guide, you'll create your first project and verify that
everything is wired up correctly.

<Highlight text="Projects are the core organizational unit in TaskForge. Almost everything you do in TaskForge happens inside a project." />

## Prerequisites

- You have the TaskForge CLI installed. See the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md).
- You are using TaskForge version `1.0.0-beta` or later.

:::tip
If you're unsure what to call your first project, start with a small, well-defined area like **acme-web-app** instead of your entire company.

## 1. Create a new project

Run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
taskforge init acme-web-app
```
