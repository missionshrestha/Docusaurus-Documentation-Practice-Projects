TaskForge is a lightweight, developer-focused project management platform.  
It combines a simple web dashboard, a powerful CLI, and a REST API so you can
create projects, manage tasks, and automate workflows directly from your tooling.

:::info
TaskForge is currently in beta. Features and APIs may change before the 1.0 release.
:::

With TaskForge you can:

- Create and organize projects by team, client, or product line
- Add, assign, and track tasks with due dates and statuses
- Integrate with your CI/CD and automation scripts via the CLI and API

If you're new here, head next to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) to get TaskForge
installed and create your first project.
